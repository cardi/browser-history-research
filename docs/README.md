# Browser History Research for Anti-Phishing

We are conducting a research study which involves studying web browsing
histories to discover and understand its commonalities.

Specifically, we are researching the distribution of website visits and
commonalities of website visits across users to understand if sharing
information about phishing targets will be effective.

For our experiment, we would like our volunteers to install a browser
extension that will record their website visit history for one week,
starting on **March 27, 2020** and ending on **April 2, 2020**, and then
share with us their anonymized history.

[Read our Call for Volunteers](call-for-volunteers.html)

## Participating in the Research Study

1. Read about the research study and procedures on the informed consent form.
2. If you wish to volunteer, sign and submit the informed consent form
   via [Google Forms][consent-google] or [PDF][consent-pdf].
3. [Install the extension](#install-the-extension)
4. On or after **April 3, 2020**, [submit your anonymized history](#instructions-for-submission).

## Install the Extension

**Google Chrome/Chromium/Brave**: visit the [Chrome Web Store][chrome]
and click on the blue "Add to Chrome".

**Firefox**: [click to download and install the add-on][ff].

The Research page has 3 sections: Truncated Browser History,
Instructions for Submission, and About the Research.

[![history page](img/browser-extension-history-th.png?raw=true)](img/browser-extension-history.png)

The Truncated Browser History displays your web history and its
anonymized form. The timestamps and anonymized domains (both in purple
text) is what we would like you to share with us (see next section).

## Submitting your Anonymized Browser History

We aggregate the purple text into a structured format in Instructions
for Submission, and provide several ways to share your data with us.

On or after **April 3, 2020**, please follow the instructions in
Instructions for Submission.

You can uninstall the extension once submission is complete:
